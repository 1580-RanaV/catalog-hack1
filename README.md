<h1><strong>Virtual Shopping Mall</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Project Overview</strong></h3>
<p>This project simulates a virtual shopping experience where users can try on different clothing items using a console-based interface. The application allows users to browse a small selection of products, choose their desired size, and receive instant feedback on how the item would fit them.</p>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Product Catalog:</strong> Browse a selection of items like t-shirts, jeans, and jackets, each available in various sizes.</li>
    <li><strong>Virtual Try-On:</strong> Select an item and input your size to simulate trying it on. The program will tell you if the size is available and how well it fits.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Simple text-based interaction allows you to easily navigate the shopping experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Output</strong></h3>
<p>The program runs entirely in the console, where you will see a list of products, select items to try on, and receive feedback on how the item fits.</p>
